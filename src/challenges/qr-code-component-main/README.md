## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass/scss
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
<!-- - [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles 
  ? Could be really helpful
-->

### Continued development

I want to find a way to have the page look good on mobile browsers. Here are what I still need to fix:

+ Make the address bar collapse on mobile when the user tries to scroll the page. At the moment, a big portion of the screen is taken by it and it would be useful to find a fix.
+ Make the card adapt better to really small mobile screens.

I also want to improve the accessibility with things like aria roles and a more semantic html.
